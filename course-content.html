       <h1><b>Q: DBMS Tutorial - Database<br>Management System :</b></h1>
       <p>Database Management System is a software or technology used to manage data from a database. Some popular databases are MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, etc. DBMS provides many operations e.g. creating a database, Storing in the database, updating an existing database, delete from the database. DBMS is a system that enables you to store, modify and retrieve data in an organized way. It also provides security to the database.</p>
      <h1>Q: Advantages of DBMS :</h1>
      <h2 >1. Data Redundancy</h2>
      <p>Unlike traditional file-system storage, Data Redundancy in DBMS is nonexistent. Data redundancy happens when the same data is stored unnecessarily in multiple locations. DBMS reduces or eliminates data redundancy by centralizing all data storage, preventing individual user and application duplication.</p>
      <h2 >2. Data Inconsistency</h2>
        <p>In traditional file system storage, the changes made by one user in one application don’t update the changes in another, given both have the same set of details. While this is not the case with DBMS systems, as there is a single repository of data that is defined once and is accessed by many users, and data are consistent.</p>
        <h2 >3. Data Shairing</h2>
       <p> Data Sharing is the primary advantage of Database management systems. DBMS system allows users and applications to share Data with multiple applications and users. One or more servers in the network store the data, and a software locking mechanism prevents simultaneous changes to the same set of data by two people. While the file system doesn’t have this capability.</p>
       <h2 >4. Data Searching</h2>
       <p>Searching and retrieving data is very easy in DBMS systems. In the case of a traditional file-based approach, the need to write separate programs for each search is eliminated. In DBMS, we can write small queries to search for multiple pieces of information at a time from the data from DB servers.</p>
       <h2 >5. Data security</h2>
      <p>DBMS systems provide a strong framework to protect data privacy and security. DBMS ensures that only authorized users have access to data, and there is a mechanism to define access privileges.</p>

       <h1>Q: Introduction of ER Model :</h1>
       <p>Peter Chen developed the ER diagram in 1976 .The ER model was created to provide a simple and understandable model for representing the structure and logic of databases. It has since evolved into variations such as the Enhanced ER Model and the Object Relationship Model.</p>
       
       <p>The Entity Relational Model is a model for identifying entities to be represented in the database and representation of how those entities are related. The ER data model specifies enterprise schema that represents the overall logical structure of a database graphically.</p>
       
       <p>The Entity Relationship Diagram explains the relationship among the entities present in the database. ER models are used to model real-world objects like a person, a car, or a company and the relation between these real-world objects. In short, the ER Diagram is the structural format of the database.</p> 
       
       <h2>Why Use ER Diagrams In DBMS?</h2>
       <p>->ER diagrams are used to represent the E-R model in a database, which makes them easy to convert into relations (tables).
       <br>->ER diagrams provide the purpose of real-world modeling of objects which makes them intently useful.
       <br>->ER diagrams require no technical knowledge and no hardware support.
       <br>->These diagrams are very easy to understand and easy to create even for a naive user. 
       <br>->It gives a standard solution for visualizing the data logically.</p>
       <h2>Symbols Used in ER Model :</h2>
       <p>ER Model is used to model the logical view of the system from a data perspective which consists of these symbols:</p>

       <h1>Q: SQL Tutorial :</h1>
       <p>SQL is not a database management system, but it is a query language which is used to store and retrieve the data from a database or in simple words SQL is a language that communicates with databases.<br>SQL makes it easy to manipulate this data using simple DML (Data Manipulation Language) Statements.</p>
       <h2>SQL Sample Database :</h2>

       <h2 style="color: black;">Why do we use databases?</h2>
       <p style="color:rgb(87, 86, 86) ;"> Databases let us work with large amounts of data efficiently. They make updating data easy and reliable, and they help to ensure accuracy. They offer security features to control access to information, and they help us avoid redundancy.</p>
       <h2 style="color: black;">When to use DBMS?</h2>
       <p style="color:rgb(87, 86, 86) ;">Enterprises that need to store data and access it later to conduct business have a viable use case for deploying a DBMS. Any application requiring a large amount of data that needs to be accessed by multiple users or customers is a candidate for using a DBMS.</p>
       <h2 style="color: black;">Is DBMS still used?</h2>
       <p style="color:rgb(87, 86, 86) ;" >Given the business world's growing focus on big data and data analytics, In addition to providing developers with the tools needed to operate databases, DBMS are also integral to the way that consumers access information through applications, which further illustrates the importance of the software.</h2>
